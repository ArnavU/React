package and package-lock keeps the track of configuration on the dependencies

we want parcel to be our dev dependencie so we used the command "npm install -D parcel" while installing

^ => caret -> for minor updates
` => tilde -> for major updates
updates automatically done

no need of uploading node_modules to github => use .gitignore
it will be automatically installed/regenerated using "npm install" since package.json and package-lock.json keeps track of all the dependencies

npm is used to install the packages
npx is used to run a particular package on a file
