package and package-lock keeps the track of configuration on the dependencies

we want parcel to be our dev dependencie so we used the command "npm install -D parcel" while installing

~ => tilde -> for patch-level updates
^ => caret -> for major updates
* => asteriks -> all the changes
updates automatically done

no need of uploading node_modules to github => use .gitignore
it will be automatically installed/regenerated using "npm install" since package.json and package-lock.json keeps track of all the dependencies

npm is used to install the packages
npx is used to run a particular package on a file


--> What is CDN?

CDN stands for Content Delivery Network. CDN links refer to the URLs or web addresses pointing to the resources (such as scripts, stylesheets, images, fonts, etc.) hosted on a Content Delivery Network. CDNs are a network of distributed servers that work together to provide fast and reliable delivery of web content to users based on their geographical location.

Using CDN links for common libraries and frameworks has become a common practice in web development. Instead of hosting these resources on your own server, you can link to CDN-hosted versions. This has several advantages:

Speed: CDNs have servers distributed worldwide, and users can load resources from a server that is geographically closer to them. This reduces latency and improves page load times.

Caching: CDNs often have caching mechanisms, allowing users to reuse resources that have already been downloaded from the same CDN by other websites. This can further improve load times.

Parallel Downloads: Browsers limit the number of simultaneous connections to a single domain. CDNs can serve resources from different domains, allowing for more parallel downloads and faster page rendering.
